My program is a fictional character creation. The user will input name, choose a gender. From there they pick three, four, and two attributes for the characterâ€™s head, torso, and legs, respectively. After that, once they click generate, the character will appear on the right. 

There are 4 templates that I use. The first is for displaying the name and gender, the second is for displaying the head attributes, the third is for displaying the torso attributes and the final one is for displaying the legs attributes. They are each displayed in a particular way and, thus, I decided to use a separate template for each.
